## AI_testing 
What is it?
Default machine learning testing with completed dataset

● 

With which tools it was made?
  •  Programming language: Python
  •  Libraries: TensorFlow, pathlib, numpy, matplotlib
  •  Additional tools (non-formal IDE): Google Colaboratory
  
●

What it can do?
This is my first attempt at creating AI using libraries and common machine learning methods.
We have a complete dataset, and we will work with this directory. 
The AI will learn to distinguish between different types of flowers.
